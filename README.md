## Introduction
&nbsp;Metastases originate from primary tumors and reach distant organs. Growing evidence suggests that metastases are under the control of primary tumors even outside the primary site; however, the mechanisms by which primary tumors remotely control metastases remain unclear. Here, we discovered a molecular mechanism by which primary tumors suppress metastatic growth. Interestingly, we found that extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from the primary tumor can inhibit the growth of metastases both in vitro and in vivo. miR-1 was particularly enriched in primary tumor-derived EVs (pTDEs) and was found to be responsible for the suppression of metastatic growth. Mechanistically, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage were induced, which led to cell cycle arrest. Collectively, our data demonstrate that primary tumors restrict the growth of distant metastases via miR-1 in pTDEs and that miR-1 could potentially be used as an antimetastatic agent.
