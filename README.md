## Introduction
&nbsp;Understanding metastasis is crucial in cancer research as well as in the clinic. Since Judah Folkman reported the metastases restricted by primary tumors via the secretion of angiostatin and endostatin, which inhibit angiogenesis on the metastatic sites, many researchers have sought to find novel tumor-derived proteins or non-coding RNAs that mediate communication between primary tumors and metastases. Recently, exosomes expressed from primary tumors have been proposed as essential communication tools for regulating metastasis, but their roles, particularly on distant metastases rather than cancer microenvironments, are still in vail. This study demonstrated how primary tumor-derived exosomes (pTDE) affect distant metastasis. First, we observed a remarkable suppression of metastatic cancer cells' growth in which received pTDE in both in vitro and in vivo spontaneous metastatic mouse models. In addition, we showed that the treatment of pTDE increased intracellular ROS and induced DNA double-stranded damage, which caused G2/M phase arrest and resulted in limiting the proliferation of recipient cells. We then identified that miR-1, which abundantly exists in the pTDE, causes a metastatic inhibition. Finally, we successfully presented the potential of pTDE as a treatment for metastatic cancer by showing that the miR-1 reinforcing pTDE significantly reduced the proliferation of metastatic cancer in mouse models. This study proves the distant control mechanism of metastatic cancer caused by primary tumors and further suggests the possibility of developing anti-cancer and metastases treatments.
